##Code Structs
The algorithm package contains some local path select algrithms- Artificial Potential Field„ÄÅ Grid method in local path select. If you want to do a new experiment for you own path select algrithms, you can extand the AbsPathControl. 

The env package contains some experiment environment description. you can extand the AbsTestEnvironmentDescription. you can run the ecperimentdescription due to the main method .

The class RobotTestSimbad in the simbad package is my test simbad.

The robot package contains RandomRobot and pathRobot . 

if you want know simbad demo you can can run SimbadTestsimbad than click the examples menu.
